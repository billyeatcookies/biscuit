Here is a directory that holds and shows preset. Write a preset for yourself as you need.

Look for the `empty.py` that shows a preset empty.

Look for the `example.lucky.py` that shows how to setup a lucky word in the welcome panel; a panel that will start at first.

Look for the `example.shells.py` that shows how to setup multiple shells.

Feel free to merge them. After editing, move the preset as `~/.biscuit/preset.entry.py`.

That's all!
